<h2>RMarkdown and Dynamic document</h2>
<p>Analyses need to be communicated to others. Publishing papers, blog posts, PowerPoint presentations, books or dashboards are many outputs or documents taht will be connected to the results analysis.</p>
<p>R Markdown permits to publish documents integrated the analysis and visualization.</p>
<p>R Markdown is a package, as well as an ecosystem of tools.</p>
<p>It allows to add R code to a plain-text file with some Markdown formatting.</p>
<p>Many output formats are rendered PDF, HTML, Microsoft Word, and Microsoft PowerPoint.</p>
<p>The rendering operation, also called knitting, runs the R code insert the resulting output and figures in the final document: a <strong>dynamic document</strong>.</p>
<p>Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund have written R Markdown: <em>The Definitive Guide</em> and also made the source R Markdown available on <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown-book">GitHub</a> <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Specialized packages extend R Markdown for blogging (<code>blogdown</code>), for books (<code>bookdown</code>), and for making gridded dashboards (<code>flexdashboard</code>).</p>
<p>The initial package in the ecosystem is called <code>knitr</code>, and we still call the process of turning R Markdown into a final format knitting the document.</p>
<p>Many output formats are supported by the R Markdown ecosystem, among which: HTML, LaTeX-pdf, Microsoft Word, and Microsoft PowerPoint.</p>
<p>R Markdown is not dependent on RStudio.
It’s possible to edit plain-text R Markdown files with a text editor and then knit the document using R’s command-line interface.</p>
<p>However, the RStudio tools are so helpful.</p>
