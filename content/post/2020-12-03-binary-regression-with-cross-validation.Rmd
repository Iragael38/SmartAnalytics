Lets try and predict if an individual will earn more than $50K (ABOVE50K) using logistic regression based on demographic variables available in the adult data. 

In this process, we will:

**Part I**   

+ Import the data
+ Estimate binary regression (logit and probit) and check some diagnostics
+ Build logit models and predict on test data
+ Do model diagnostics

**Part II** 

+ Create training and test samples
+ Compare the cross-validation results with the regression only results

## Load the data

```{r}
inputData <- read.csv("data/adult.csv")
head(inputData)
```

## Some summary stat

```{r}
kable(table(inputData$ABOVE50K)/length(inputData$ABOVE50K), 
      caption = "Count table" ,  digits = 3,
      col.names = c("ABOVE50K", "Freq"), align = "cc"
      )

kable( list(
  table(inputData$RELATIONSHIP)/length(inputData$RELATIONSHIP),   
  table(inputData$OCCUPATION)/length(inputData$OCCUPATION)    ),
      caption = "Count table of categorical explanatory variables" ,  digits = 3 
  
)
```

# Part I
## Estimate P(Above50K = 1) as function of `RELATIONSHIP + AGE + CAPITALGAIN + OCCUPATION + EDUCATIONNUM`

```{r}
logitMod <- glm(ABOVE50K ~ RELATIONSHIP + AGE + CAPITALGAIN + OCCUPATION + EDUCATIONNUM, data=inputData, family=binomial(link="logit"))

summary(logitMod)
```

We see significant coefficients We can interpret their signs, but not their values.

For categorical variables, we see all levels but one. R creates binary variable for each level of the factor variables. One of these variables have to be excluded from the model (the model could not be estimated otherwise).

The excluded level is the first level by alphabetical order, by default. This level is used as the reference level for interpretation of the other levels.

Hence, for RELATIONSHIP, the reference level is `husband`. All negative (resp. positive) coefficients indicate a decrease (resp. increase) in the probability of event, relatively to the probability of the `husband` level.

The same idea for OCCUPATION, with a reference labeled `?` let say "undetermined". A non significant coefficient, as  `Armed-Forces` indicates that the level has no significant difference in probability of event compared to the probability of the reference level.

Based on this result, we could think about gathering all non significantly different levels in a group level.


### Quality of fit

We can perform an equivalent test of the Fischer test in OLS regression, testing for global significance of the model.

$H_0:$ all $\beta$ are null except the intercept

vs.

$H_1$: at least one variable has significant effect

for such test, we can use `anova()` function, which compare the likelihood of the null model to the unrestricted model:

```{r}
# test for the full model against the 0-model
glm0 <- glm(ABOVE50K ~ 1 , data=inputData, family=binomial(link="logit"))
anova(glm0, logitMod, test="Chisq")
```

As expected, the p-value is small, $H_0$ is rejected. This is in line with the p-values from the significance test per variable (several coefficients are highly significant in the results table)



### Coefficients inference

We can build confidence interval of the estimated coefficients and the odds ratios.
We observe narrow interval, indicating good precision in estimate (low standard errors).
Of course zero is not in CI for significant coefficients

Interpretations of OR are relative to the reference level for categorical variables.


```{r warning=FALSE}
# IC
confint(logitMod)

# Odd Ratio interpretation
exp(logitMod$coefficients)
```

### Constraints test between coefficients

Wald test can be used 

+ to test significant impact of `farm-fishing` level of OCCUPATION: $H_0$ : $\beta_{\text{farm-fishing}} = 0$
+ to test equal impact of two levels of RELATIONSHIP: $H_0$ : $\beta_{\text{Not-in-family}} = \beta_{\text{Other-relative}}$
which can be written:  $\beta_{\text{Not-in-family}} - \beta_{\text{Other-relative}} = 0$

```{r}
# Wald.test: Occupation=farm-fishing
library(aod)
wald.test(b=coef(logitMod), Sigma=vcov(logitMod), Terms=13)
# Wald Test: Rel:Not-in-family = Rel: Other-relative
restr <- rbind(c(0, -1, 1, 0,0,0, rep(0,17)))
wald.test(b = coef(logitMod), Sigma = vcov(logitMod), L = restr)
```
First assumption is not reject (accordingly to the p-value of this test and the one of the coefficient).

Second assumption is rejected with risk 10%


### Multicolinearity diagnostic

Multicolinearity can be evaluated with VIF (Variance Inflation Factor). GReater than 10, VIF would indicate excessive multicolinearity


```{r}
# VIF diagnostic
library(car)
vif(logitMod)
```


# Part I
Analyse prediction capacity with or without Cross validation


## Create Training Data and Test Data

To preserve proportions of success and failure, we split the original data and pick 70% in each subsets.

```{r}
input_ones <- inputData[which(inputData$ABOVE50K == 1), ]  # all 1's
input_zeros <- inputData[which(inputData$ABOVE50K == 0), ]  # all 0's
set.seed(101)  # for repeatability of samples
# we pick row numbers 
input_ones_training_rows <- sample(1:nrow(input_ones), 0.7*nrow(input_ones))  # 1's for training
input_zeros_training_rows <- sample(1:nrow(input_zeros), 0.7*nrow(input_zeros))  # 0's for training. Pick as many 0's as 1's
# we select data based on picked row numbers
training_ones <- input_ones[input_ones_training_rows, ]  
training_zeros <- input_zeros[input_zeros_training_rows, ]
trainingData <- rbind(training_ones, training_zeros)  # row bind the 1's and 0's 
# Create Test Data
test_ones <- input_ones[-input_ones_training_rows, ]
test_zeros <- input_zeros[-input_zeros_training_rows, ]
testData <- rbind(test_ones, test_zeros)  # row bind the 1's and 0's 
```

## Estimate and Predict

```{r}
kable(list(
      prop.table(table(inputData$ABOVE50K)), 
      prop.table(table(trainingData$ABOVE50K)), 
      prop.table(table(testData$ABOVE50K))
      ),
      caption = "Proportions in Original Data" ,  digits = 3,
      col.names = c("ABOVE50K", "Freq"), align = "cc"
      )
```

Proportions are respected

### Estimation on training dataset

```{r}
logitModT <- glm(ABOVE50K ~ RELATIONSHIP + AGE + CAPITALGAIN + OCCUPATION + EDUCATIONNUM, data=trainingData, family=binomial(link="logit"))

summary(logitModT)
```

We get almost the same results as on original data.

### Prediction on the test dataset

We predict probabilities of success for the test dataset.

```{r}
# two equivalent functions
predicted <- plogis(predict(logitModT, testData))  # predicted scores
# or
predicted <- predict(logitModT, testData, type="response")  # predicted scores
```


## Evaluation of prediction

```{r}
# Classification Diagnostic
#install.packages("InformationValue")
library(InformationValue)
# optimal cut-off proba that minimizes the misclassification error for the above model
optCutOff <- optimalCutoff(testData$ABOVE50K, predicted)[1] 
# percentage mismatch of predicted vs actuals
misClassError(testData$ABOVE50K, predicted, threshold = optCutOff)

```

## ROC curve and confusion matrix

```{r}
plotROC(testData$ABOVE50K, predicted)
# Sensitivity: proportion of non-events that are correctly predicted
# Specificity: proportion of events that are correctly predicted

Concordance(testData$ABOVE50K, predicted)
# % of true positive
sensitivity(testData$ABOVE50K, predicted, threshold = optCutOff)
# % of true negative
specificity(testData$ABOVE50K, predicted, threshold = optCutOff)

confusionMatrix(testData$ABOVE50K, predicted, threshold = optCutOff)
```

## version 2: ROC curve and confusion matrix



```{r}
classDF <- data.frame(response = logitModT$y, predicted = round(fitted(logitModT),0))
xtabs(~ predicted + response, data = classDF)
                                                             
ClassTab <- xtabs(~ predicted + response, data = classDF)
(ClassTab[1,1] + ClassTab[2,2] ) / sum(ClassTab)                                                             
                                                             
predpr <- predict(logitModT,type=c("response"))
library(pROC)
roccurve <- roc(trainingData$ABOVE50K ~ predpr)
plot(roccurve)
auc(roccurve)

```
## Comparison with the Original data estimation


```{r}
predicted <- plogis(predict(logitMod, inputData))  # predicted scores
optCutOff <- optimalCutoff(inputData$ABOVE50K, predicted)[1] 
# percentage mismatch of predicted vs actuals
misClassError(inputData$ABOVE50K, predicted, threshold = optCutOff)
plotROC(inputData$ABOVE50K, predicted)
Concordance(inputData$ABOVE50K, predicted)
# % of true positive
sensitivity(inputData$ABOVE50K, predicted, threshold = optCutOff)
# % of true negative
specificity(inputData$ABOVE50K, predicted, threshold = optCutOff)

confusionMatrix(inputData$ABOVE50K, predicted, threshold = optCutOff)
```

Results appear to be equivalent using cross validation or not. 

Of course it could be lucky situation. We should iterate the cross valiadtion many times and check stability of the results with the random sampling of the training and test samples...
