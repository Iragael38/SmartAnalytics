## Motivation

Industry 4.0, Digital Factory, Internet of Things, Digital Economy: they all name the fusion of the physical and virtual and digital worlds. Data has become a key asset in the global and digital economy; the amount of collectible, collected and available data keeps growing at a tremendous pace, whereas data sources and dimensions (temporal/spatial, numerical/textual) become more and more complex. 
Future industrial practices will rely more deeply on information and data management and analytics. Digitization spreading, new communication tools, measure and observation tools (sensor, camera, smartphones, ...) increase needs to collect, stock, organize, secure, consult, extract and analyze data. These new data are characterized by their volume, variety and velocity.

Assessing the relevance of data and selecting the **right data for business decisions** is a key strategic capability.

Analysis of complex and big data, temporal  and spatial data needs specific skills to search and to extract the relevant information and to analyze them accordingly with their specific dimensions.



## Lessons planning {#Lessons-planning}

Each lesson is described as follows

## Organisation
### Posts

Posts will be used to manage the contact (prof $\rightarrow$ student), as notification during the semester

### Caseine 

The *Moodle* based platform **Caseine** is used for this lesson to interact and to exchange document and to perform some online test.



## Evaluation

- *individual grade* Exam at the end of the semester
- *group grade* Project grade: defense + report

### Final Project

The final project is a long project managed during almost a month.

It is based on real and complex data. 

Each group of students has to study one research question based on 
- a search for specific litterature on this question
- the proposed data (common to the class)
- to build their own analysis (drawing hypothesis from the litterature to be tested with the data using DCM)
