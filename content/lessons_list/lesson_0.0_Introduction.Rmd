# Plan and Organisation of the lesson

## Today

1. Introduction (45min)
2. Reproducible research (45min)
   + *in-class*: introduction & demo
   + *out-of-class*: reading
3. Case Study (1h30min)
   + Team work on Data Visualizations
   + Discussion

# Introduction
## Context 

- Industry 4.0, Digital Factory, Internet of Things, Digital Economy

- Assessing the relevance of data and selecting the **right data for business decisions** is a key strategic capability.

- Analysis of complex and **big data**, **temporal**  and **spatial** data 

   + needs **specific skills** to search and to extract the relevant information 
   + to **analyze** them accordingly with their specific dimensions.
   
##  Some definitions

**Many notions**

For examples *"AT&T business" offers*

> Data science solutions for IoT including Artificial Intelligence and machine learning

### Big Data

- most cited definition of big data includes the 3Vs (**Volume, Variety, and Velocity**) *Laney (2001)*
- big data should include ‘**Value**’ *(Gantz et al., 2011)*
- big data should also have ‘**Veracity**’ *(Zikopoulos et al., 2013)*

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## Industrial issues


### **Smart Analytics in Industry 4.0**

@LEE20143 identify that

- self-learning machines are still far from implementation in current industries
- advances are expected in 5 distinct categories:

1. *Manager and Operator Interaction*: machine control and schedule design have to include machines health
1. *Machine fleet*: prognostic and health management methods have to consider the fleet of machines

_ _ _

1. *Product and Process Quality*: product quality informs on the process quality
1. *Big Data and Cloud*: Data management and distribution in Big Data environment
1. *Sensor and Controller Network*: decision-making algorithms depend on wrong and inaccurate readings

_ _ _

#### **Smart Machine Maintenance**

+ Machine health awareness analytics with self-learning knowledge base

+ Decision support analytics for self-maintenance


#### **Servitization** 

- to shift from selling products, to selling an integrated product and service offering that delivers value in use (@Martinezetal2010)

_ _ _

#### **Product-Service System (PSS)**

- system of products, services, supporting networks, and infrastructure
that is designed to be competitive, satisfy customers' needs,
and have a lower environmental impact than traditional
business models (@Mont2004)


- Market goal of manufacturers: 
  + is not one-time product selling, but
  + continuous profit from customers by total service solution, which can satisfy unmet customers’ needs.

_ _ _

### Industrial big data environment

Industry 4.0 with *Smart Machine Maintenance*, *servitization* and *PSS* imply:

- different units of observation, analyse and decision
  + from 'human-related data' to 'machine generated data' (machine, controllers, sensors, manufacturing systems, etc.)
  + sales prediction, user relationship mining and clustering, recommendation systems,
opinion mining, etc. 

_ _ _

- SI networks. From the sensor to the dashboard and decision
  + compatibility and standard issue
  + vibration, pressure, etc. are added to historical data
  + this aggregation is  called “Big Data”
- not a one shot process: dynamic workflow
  +  integrated platform, predictive analytics, and visualization
tools



## Conclusion

Challenges are to switch:

- from Data Analytics
- to DS projects, including 
  + BD dimension
  + DM
  + DA
  + OR

> **DS and OR : the new challenges**

## Organisation of the course

- Data supply-chain: from data collection and production, storage and organization, management, exploitation and analysis, and communication. 

- Big data and dynamic process of analysis needs transparent, repeatable and reproducible technics. 

- Backward presentation: from needs to solutions


## Three +1 parts

2) **Exploration of complex data with high dimensionality** 

3)	**Analysis of complex data with temporal and / or spatial dimensions** 

4)	**Visualization  and communication**
